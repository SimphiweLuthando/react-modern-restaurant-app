## Introduction
This is a code repository for the React modern restaurant project on my portfolio site. It features a dynamic menu including table reservation

## How It's Made

__Tech used:__ HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS

Here I had to utilize functional components and their reusability to efficiently create the different elements of the app. You will also notice the use of clean React file and folder structure.

The CSS aspect of the app makes use of flex and grid to help create a modern responsive feel to the app as well as have animations and complex gradients
